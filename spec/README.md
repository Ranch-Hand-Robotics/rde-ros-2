This directory contains technical specifications, proposals, and design documents for features in the ROS 2 VS Code extension.

## Purpose

The `/spec` directory is for:
- **Feature proposals** - Design documents for new features
- **Technical specifications** - Detailed technical designs and architecture
- **API specifications** - Interface and protocol definitions
- **Design mockups** - UI/UX designs and wireframes

## Structure

Each feature or component should have its own subdirectory containing:
- Proposal/specification documents
- Architecture diagrams
- Technical design details
- Mockups and examples

## User Documentation

User-facing documentation should be placed in the `/docs` directory, not here. The `/docs` directory is used to build public documentation.
