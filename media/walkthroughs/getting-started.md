# Getting Started with Robot Developer Extensions for ROS 2

Welcome to the Robot Developer Extensions for ROS 2! This extension provides powerful debugging and development support for ROS 2 on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Features

* **Automatic ROS environment configuration** - The extension detects and configures your ROS 2 environment automatically
* **Debug ROS Launch Files** - Run and debug ROS nodes launched from `.launch.py` files with breakpoint support
* **Test Explorer** - Discover and run ROS 2 tests with integrated Test Explorer
* **IntelliSense** - Get code completion, hover information, and go-to-definition for ROS message files
* **Build Integration** - Automatically create `colcon` build and test tasks

## Next Steps

1. **Install ROS 2** - If you haven't already, install ROS 2 on your system (see the platform-specific guides)
2. **Open a ROS 2 Workspace** - Open a folder containing a ROS 2 workspace with `package.xml` files
3. **Configure the Environment** - The extension will automatically detect and configure your ROS 2 environment
4. **Start Developing** - Use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) to access ROS 2 commands
