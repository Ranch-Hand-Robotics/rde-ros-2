# Troubleshooting the Robot Developer Extensions
ROS 2 is a complex system, and issues can arise from various sources. AI and the VSCode ecosystem are fast moving targets. This document provides troubleshooting tips for self-diagnosing and common issues encountered when using the Robot Developer Extensions for ROS 2.

## Output Panel
The VSCode output panel provides detailed logs from the Robot Developer Extensions. You can access it by going to `Output: Focus on Output View` or using the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+U`. In the dropdwon next to the Filter edit box, select `ROS 2`.

Look for any error messages or warnings that might indicate what is going wrong.
